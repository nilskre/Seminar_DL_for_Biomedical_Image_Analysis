\section*{Abstract}

The area of neuroscience deals with the understanding of the brain. Especially interesting is the connection of different brain regions to specific neurological disorders or cognitive stimuli. 
In the work by Li et al. \cite{LI2021102233} a novel Brain Graph Neural Network is proposed to analyze the data obtained through fMRI imaging of the brain. The novelties of this work are a new graph convolutional layer and the interpretability of the model results. 
The proposed model outperforms all compared baseline architectures in the prediction task on two evaluation datasets. Furthermore, the insights gained through the model's interpretability could be verified by literature.
