\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

The work by Li et al. \cite{LI2021102233} proposes a novel Brain Graph Neural Network for fMRI analysis. The two main innovations are the improved graph con\-vo\-lu\-tio\-nal layer and the inbuilt interpretability through various loss terms as part of the graph pooling layer.

The result of Li et al. \cite{LI2021102233} is a BrainGNN model, which outperforms all other approaches for both prediction tasks. Furthermore the detection of group-level and individual-level biomarkers is possible. Moreover it is possible to detect brain communities.

Through this work the understanding of neurological diseases can be improved, which is essential for the development of personalized treatments in the area of precision medicine.
